#+title:  Envisage 12.0 - Microcontrollers Module

* What even is a microcontroller?
A microcontroller is basically a small computer, whose main job is to control electronics. Just like your normal computers, it has a CPU, some RAM and some flash memory to store your program. It also has programmable IO (Input/Ouput) pins. These pins are what helps them 'control' your electronics. There are tons of microcontrollers available in the market. The most popular one being the Arduino UNO. Now just to clarify, Arduino UNO is not actually the microcontroller, rather, it is just a 'development board' built around the ATmega328P microcontroller. Development boards make it easy for us to work with microcontrollers, as they have additional circuits designed to help run and program them.

* Setup
** Arduino IDE
The Arduino IDE is the most common program that you will be using while working with an Arduino (and many other microcontrollers). You can download it from [[https://www.arduino.cc/en/software][here.]]
** Tinkercad
We will be using Tinkercad throughout this module for easy simulations. Go [[https://www.tinkercad.com/][here]] and make an account if u don't have one.

* Blink Blink!
Let's start with the 'Hello World' of microcontrollers, ie, blinking an LED. Go to [[https://www.tinkercad.com/things/7yLiom529nh?sharecode=YH0h8LwFxTxKPVEX33UE6I2a3gyqSZu9YfV1jaytJTc][this]] example. Click on 'Tinker this' and then 'Start Simulation'. Click on 'Code' to see the magic behind all of it. As you can see, the code is made up of two 'functions', namely ~void setup()~ and ~void loop()~. The important part:
- ~void setup()~ : Runs *once* at the *start*.
- ~void loop()~ : Obviously, keeps running in a *loop*.
